# Jelle Mathis Kuiper

I am a PhD Student at [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de). My supervisor is [Otmar Spinas](https://www.math.uni-kiel.de/logik/de/spinas).

My research interests are:

- Axiomatic Set Theory
- Forcing
- Cardinal Invariants of the Real Line

## Education

I majored in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at Kiel University. The following is an (incomplete) list of the subjects I studied. I excluded subjects that are standard or which I am not comfortable to talk about.

- Mathematical Logic, Axiomatic Set Theory, Forcing
- Functional Analysis and its Applications in Ergodic Theory
- Algorithms and Data Structures, Theoretical Computer Science, High Performance Computing
- Stochastic Processes, Statistics
- Numerical Methods for PDEs, Large Linear Systems, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

During my studies I have written two theses. Both were supervised by [Markus Haase](https://www.math.uni-kiel.de/analysis/de/haase).

- Bachelor Thesis: "On the Cohen--Hewitt Factorization Theorem and its Applications to Convolution Algebras"
- Master Thesis: "The Universal Topological Dynamical System with Quasi-Discrete Spectrum"

## Teaching

The following is a list of the courses for which I have been a teaching assistent in chronological order. The titles are good approximations of the original german titles.

1. Elementary Numerical Methods
2. Numerical Programming
3. Introduction to Numerical Analysis
4. Probability Theory
5. ODEs and the Multidimensional Riemann Integral
6. Functional Analysis
7. Measure and Integration Theory and ODEs
8. Complex Analysis
9. Forcing
